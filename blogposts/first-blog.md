# My Journey into Fitness and Bodybuilding
&nbsp;
![My Transformation](/blogimages/transformation.jpg)&nbsp;

## Introduction

&nbsp;

I am a bodybuilder, currently 31 years old bodybuilder, personal trainer, and a software developer. I go to the gym about 5-6 times a week, for about 1 and a half hours,
I usually take my car or bike, because it's a great way to get some cardio in. When I am not gymming, I am usually learning something new or improving myself by working on one of my skills, which can be about fitness, 
or about software development. It's all about getting better every day.
&nbsp;
Some of my other hobbies include beach, dancing, karaoke. I like a range of music genre's, but my favorite are nu-metal songs by bands like Slipknot, Disturbed, Mudvayne, Korn. 
&nbsp;
One of the first things that motivated me to get into wanting to get bigger muscles, funny enough, I must admit was an anime series called Dragon Ball Z.
When I was a kid after I watched the series, I would always go nuts doing press ups, I had some small 6kg dumbbells at home and I used to curl them. 
&nbsp;
I always used to be a skinny kid though, with an unusual incredible amount of strength, for some reason eventhough I was short, I was always either the strongest, or one of the strongest
kid in my classes, I overpowered many guys much heavier and taller. 
&nbsp;
However, as I was getting into my late teens I was starting to fall back a little bit due to lower physical activity and addiction to video games, I ended up spending 12 hours a day, and I am pretty sure I did
it to cope with some of the bad parts in my life at the time, it was like an escape from reality, by living in a fantasy world. Even then I was always sort of trying to feel like im making progress in life by 
gaining virtual achievements called Xbox gamerscore  lol.
&nbsp;
Anyhow, that addiction went on from around 14 years - 20 years old, around 18 years of age, I decided it was finally time to make a change. My resolve for making a change in my mundane life was really strong, I
went on long marathon runs starting at 2km and worked my way up to 19km, and lifting weights at home again. I found it a great stress relief and a way to exhaust all the energy I had to want to change
my life. I joined the uni gym for about 6 months and did not know what I was doing, then quit. It didn't feel like the running or gym helped me much in terms of my looks and confidence with my body.
My motivation was sort of dieing off at that point and I sort of stopped trying for around another year and a bit, and just kept gaming away.
&nbsp;
At around 20 years of age, again I was getting fed up with a mundane life, I again decided it's time to make a change. I joined a commercial gym and started lifting weights in the hopes to get bigger, again I spent about 6 months and still did not see much change. Then I stumbled upon the fact I can actually use the internet for gaining knowledge on how to train, it was all about finding the right resources. I started reading articles on how to get bigger, I researched forums and blogs and followed some of the exercise routines on there. I found inspiration from Arnold who always spoke about not wanting to look like everyone else, and I realised how much I wanted the same, I also saw other fitness models inspirational physiques online. From there it took me about 6-8 months before I started seeing real gains, and looked like I left. Might I say this wasn't just an easy 6 months, when I trained I train with a phenonmal amount of rage, and powered through my workouts, taking myself beyond boundaries.
&nbsp;
Once the gains kicked in, as in going from 55kgs skinny to about 70kg muscular build, people started noticing it, girls started looking at me, when I started getting compliments for the first time in my life from random people that didn't know me, that all amplified my motivation 3x fold. 
&nbsp;
From there keeping a regular consistent routine was easier, I went on for 14 years now on and off, and won several gold, silver, and bronze medals in bodybuilding competitions. I did have some on and off times still due to other life events and injuries, but I learn to work around them, and learn to train smarter each time. Injuries are an unfortunate hold back, and learning to train with proper form, and training smart as in steadily increasing intensity, as a beginner not starting off with the maximum weight. Sometimes injuries are hard to avoid when you are training extremely hard for a competition, sometimes even the best can get it, for instance Ronnie Coleman, but taking that risk is what put him up there, it is what made me one of the biggest natural bodybuilders, it's all about trying your best to manage the intensity when training in an extremely competitive nature, however you can still make incredible gains while not putting the maximum effort beyond reason for the sake of competition.
&nbsp;
So basically at this point, I learnt the main thing that was keeping me from reaching my potential was lack of knowledge, I always had the motivation for it. And I want to make sure I can help others too reach their potential.
This just goes to show how the start is always the hardest part, but once you do the hard yard and reach a certain point... It's all sunshine and rainbows from there.. at least in terms of getting on the gain train.. not in terms of your workouts, because the bigger and stronger you get physically, you also build your mental strength, and the tolerance of pushing yourself further, physically and mentally through rigorous workouts.
&nbsp;


I always had a good base to start with, but I am sure it wasn't just the natural strength I had, but the will to win that put me in that place, and that I have come to learn is what truly but me where I am now in terms of my physique. 

I came to achieve a physique naturally, that most people would love to have. Now I want to use what I learnt, and my motivation in the sport to help others also achieve their true potential.
