# My Journey into Fitness and Bodybuilding

## Introduction
&nbsp; 

I'm a 31-year-old bodybuilder, personal trainer, and software developer. Fitness has been a central part of my life for years. On average, I hit the gym 5-6 times a week, dedicating about 1.5 hours each session. Whether by car or push bike when I want to get some cardio in, I make my way to the gym. When not at the gym, I'm constantly learning and honing my skills, be it in fitness or software development. Improvement is my daily mantra.

My hobbies extend to the beach, dancing, and karaoke. Music-wise, I have an eclectic taste, but I find myself most drawn to the raw energy of nu-metal bands like Slipknot, Disturbed, Mudvayne, and Korn. I also like other hard rock bands, pop, country, classic etc.

&nbsp;
## Early Inspiration
&nbsp;

The anime series Dragon Ball Z ignited my fascination with musclular look and strength. As a kid, I'd occassionally smash out some push ups, or curl using small dumbbells at home, in the hopes of looking like the characters. Despite my modest stature, being short, and small framed, I possessed an uncanny strength that often outmatched my larger peers, mostly from willpower.

&nbsp;

## Adolescent Challenges

&nbsp;


In my late teens, the sedentary lifestyle and video game addiction took a toll. Spending up to 12 hours a day in virtual worlds was my coping mechanism. Although I was grappling with personal issues, this escape helped me navigate through.

&nbsp;


## A Turning Point

&nbsp;

Around 18, I mustered the determination to attempt to break free from this cycle. Long-distance runs and weightlifting at home became my therapy. It was both a stress reliever and a means to channel my pent-up energy. Joining the university gym for a brief stint of 6 months, did not yield the results I sought. I had pretty much given up at this point.

&nbsp;

## Rediscovering Purpose

&nbsp;

At 20, I resolved to change my life's trajectory. A commercial gym membership and a newfound penchant for internet research became my ticket to transformation. Engulfed in articles, forums, and blogs, I meticulously curated my workout routines. Arnold Schwarzenegger's ethos of individuality in physique resonated with me. It took 6-8 months of grueling workouts before the gains became evident.

&nbsp;

## The Tipping Point

&nbsp;

Going from a lanky 55kg to a robust 70kg was a turning point. The recognition from others, especially women, and unsolicited compliments fueled my motivation exponentially.

&nbsp;

## Steadfast Progress

&nbsp;

Over 14 years, with intermittent breaks ranging from 1-8 months, I clinched numerous bodybuilding competitions. Navigating through injuries and life events, I learned to train smarter. Injuries can sometimes be inevitable in this pursuit, especially when training at a competitive level, but understanding one's limits, and easing into a new exercise, when changing routines is pivotal.

&nbsp;

## Training Philosophy

&nbsp;

My approach to training, would be a combination of bodybuilding and powerlifting, that is either mixing hypertrophy and strength based routines in one, or alternating between them. This approach gives you the best of both worlds. This means that if you are stronger, you will be able to do more reps with more weight, resulting in more muscle growth.

&nbsp;

## Epiphany

&nbsp;

Knowledge emerged as the missing link to unlocking my potential. My motivation was unwavering, but acquiring the right knowledge was the game-changer. Now, I aspire to empower others to realize their true potential.
Imagine having the single point in your life, that may not come back, where you decide to give it your all in making a change in your body, but you give up due to lack of results. These decisions to have a resolution may not always come by, but when they do maximize it's effectiveness by having all aspects required from proper training techniques, proper nutrition, lifestyle habits, and training hard.

&nbsp;

## Lessons for the Journey

&nbsp;

- Consistency trumps all.
- Adaptability is key, especially in the face of challenges.
- Understand your body's signals and limitations.
