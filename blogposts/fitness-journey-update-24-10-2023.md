# Embracing Change: Navigating Through My Fitness Journey

&nbsp;

Greetings, fellow fitness enthusiasts!

&nbsp;

I wanted to take a moment to share an important update on my fitness journey. Over the past few months, I've been on what some might call a "dirty bulk" phase. It's been a period of intense training and a more liberal approach to nutrition, all in the pursuit of muscle growth and strength gains.

&nbsp;

However, as the saying goes, change is the only constant. I've decided to shift gears and transition into a new phase: a focused effort on reducing body fat. It's a commitment that requires diligence, dedication, and a keen eye on both diet and exercise.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, about three weeks ago, I encountered an injury to my lat muscle. This unexpected event has prompted a necessary adjustment in my fitness approach. Instead of diving headfirst into an aggressive cutting phase, I've chosen a path of maintenance.

&nbsp;

Incorporating a slight calorie surplus of 100-200 daily, this approach allows me to balance the need for muscle preservation while still creating a modest energy surplus. Given my current situation, I must be cautious with pulling exercises to prevent exacerbating my injury. This measured approach helps safeguard against potential muscle loss that could occur from a reduction in the intensity of these exercises while on a caloric deficit.

&nbsp;

The cause of this injury is likely attributed to the significant intensity I applied during my back training session. In preparation for an upcoming reunion, I pushed myself to achieve my peak strength and an incredible pump. Perhaps I may have overstepped a bit, but this is all part of the process of achieving a remarkable physique naturally. It's about pushing the boundaries of what my body can achieve, even if it comes with some risks.

&nbsp;

In the world of fitness, we often hear that lifting heavy is paramount during a cutting phase to preserve muscle mass. While this principle holds true, I recognize the need to gradually resume my regular lifting routine before transitioning into a full-fledged cutting phase.

&nbsp;

This time around, my focus is on clean maintenance. I will be trying to put aside the days of "dirty bulk" mentality. I'm committed to nourishing my body with quality nutrients that promote overall well-being.

&nbsp;

I'm excited for this new chapter in my fitness journey, and I'm grateful for your continued support and encouragement. Together, we'll navigate through these changes, learning and growing along the way.

&nbsp;

Remember, change is not a setback, but an opportunity for growth and improvement. Here's to the next phase of our fitness adventures!

Stay strong and stay committed!
